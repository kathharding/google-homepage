write a brief introduction for what the current project is and what skills you have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project which is a good way to revise what you have learned.)

This is a mini-project demonostrating that I know how to deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. 

Thus far this has been an interesting journey. I've learned about Git and Github, how to command the Command Line, and getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. I haven't started Javascript or any other programming languages yet but I'm eager to learn.
